### 2026-08-12 G-02 Data Governance Technical Candidate

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The frozen G-02 design is implemented with isolated stores, fail-closed deduplication, authenticated recovery, repository privacy checks and a Unity asset-license gate; synthetic evidence passes while unavailable formal-machine and asset controls remain visibly blocked; task state moves to `IN_REVIEW`, not `DONE`. |
| Actual Result | Implementation commit `befbdb698ef5cbeb6061315a4c912abdde4e6b08` added the governance module and Unity gate. G-02 reports 107专项 tests passing, a passing synthetic rehearsal and zero repository privacy violations. The current asset scan covers 179 items and blocks on three license groups; the formal environment check blocks on six missing controls. The registry now has READY=F-03/F-04/G-01/P-01/P-02 and IN_REVIEW=G-02. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The first regenerated PDF still listed G-02 among six READY packages on page 7. The Markdown source was corrected, the PDF rebuilt and pages 7-8 re-rendered; the final document shows five READY packages and G-02 separately as `IN_REVIEW`. No formal credential was provisioned and no external gate was closed. |
| Verification Command | G-02 pytest `107 passed`; root pytest `207 passed in 15.91s`; F-01 contract pytest `49 passed in 0.89s`; `compileall`; protocol-authority validator PASS; registry validator PASS for 51 entries; independent-package validator PASS for 6 packages and 127 snapshots; repository privacy PASS with 0 violations; expected fail-closed asset/environment exits both 2; `git diff --check`; added-line terminology and sensitive-extension scans. |
| PDF QA | `02_固定任务概要.pdf` has 8 A4 pages and SHA-256 `17D2B4F07E0213CCD3C84437027ADA6A89336A82DDACF7A401FB1A447FED4381`. All pages were rendered at 120 DPI and visually checked; the corrected pages have no clipping, overlap, unreadable text or status conflict. |
| Residual Risk | G-02 cannot become `DONE` until a dedicated account and separated encrypted roots exist, the Credential Manager target and sealed recovery evidence are configured, retention receives institutional approval, all three Unity asset groups are cleared or excluded, and a real independent team member signs the second-review report. Formal contact collection, formal sessions and Unity release remain blocked. |

### 2026-08-04 Project Status And Top-Level Design Summary

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The project has one navigable summary that separates repository reality from target design, consolidates confirmed product and research decisions, labels pending proposals, and identifies the exact gates before team task-package decomposition. |
| Actual Result | Added `00-项目管理/看板与进度/2026-08-04_项目情况与顶层设计汇总.md`, linked it from M00, added U41 to the Grill record, and updated the blackboard. The summary covers product boundaries, four modules, runtime timeline, two contribution objects, three-stage evidence, data processing, result-to-claim limits, publication narrative, output portfolio, responsibility directions, current gaps, and pending decisions. Full Python regression passed: `42 passed in 8.21s`. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The historical stage board still says delivery and archival work, while the confirmed research direction is in top-level redesign. The summary records this divergence but does not silently rewrite the historical board. One draft line said four complete orders and was corrected to 24 before staging. |
| Verification Command | Targeted `rg` checks for all required sections and status labels; restricted-term scan; Markdown relative-link check; `git diff --check`; full Python test command; final staged-file and Git status checks. |
| Residual Risk | The causal claim scope, abstract-pacer baseline, primary process endpoint, noninferiority margin, revised model hierarchy, sample size, policy specification, target architecture, and implementation task packages remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-04 Reframe Core Paper Contributions

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The Grill record identifies scene-native breathing guidance and explainable closed-loop sequence orchestration as the two contribution objects, demotes causal sequence evaluation and adaptive optimization to an evidence chain, and preserves the fixed-pair identification boundary. |
| Actual Result | Added U40 and updated the blackboard. Defined a reusable five-stage scene-native mapping grammar, minimum formal and replay requirements for the orchestration method, the three-stage evidence chain, superseded title language, and the next gate on the primary empirical claim and minimum comparison baseline. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The prior framing treated rigorous evaluation and adaptive functionality as contributions in themselves. U40 explicitly corrects that category error without discarding the already confirmed balanced exploration, process analysis, policy learning, or independent confirmation design. |
| Verification Command | Targeted `rg` checks for U40, both contribution objects, the mapping grammar, orchestration requirements, evidence-chain roles, fixed-pair and comparison boundaries, the superseded title, and the new next gate; restricted-term scan over changed lines; `git diff --check`; final `git status --short`. |
| Residual Risk | The unique empirical claim for scene-native guidance, its minimum comparison baseline, formal policy representation, low-degree-of-freedom contrast, revised hierarchy, sample size, and study outcomes remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-04 Confirm Uniform 120-Second Module Timeline

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The Grill record fixes an identical 120-second timeline for all modules, separates demonstration, primary closed-loop analysis, and locked transition phases, and prevents scripted completion from contaminating the real-data window. |
| Actual Result | Added U39 and updated the blackboard. Fixed 0-15 seconds as native demonstration, 15-105 seconds as the unique primary real-device closed-loop window, and 105-120 seconds as a locked-state automatic transition. Recorded an eight-minute four-module experience, continued raw logging outside the primary window, fallback marking, scale timing, and minimum cross-product stage fields. |
| Deviation / Surprise | None. Different protocols will produce different numbers of completed breath cycles inside the same 90-second window; this remains a measurable protocol feature rather than a reason to vary module duration. |
| Verification Command | Targeted `rg` checks for U39, confirmed status, all phase boundaries, 480-second total, unique analysis window, locked-state semantics, no forced complete recovery, fallback marking, scale timing, and the next gate; restricted-term scan over changed lines; `git diff --check`; final `git status --short`. |
| Residual Risk | Native animation details, fallback weather behavior, final data-contract names, data-quality thresholds, the low-degree-of-freedom theory contrast, revised test hierarchy, and revised sample size remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-04 Remove Common Participant Breathing Circle

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The Grill record removes the common participant-facing breathing circle and assigns guidance, feedback, onboarding, and degraded behavior to each weather's native visual mechanism while preserving TD as an operator-only monitor. |
| Actual Result | Added U38 and updated the blackboard. Removed the common circle, dual-circle HUD, and TD Spout breathing texture from the target participant experience; assigned native visual carriers to all four modules; required native onboarding and degraded cues; and marked the current Unity circle dependency as a superseded implementation baseline. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The user input used “溢出” in a context where “移除” is the coherent operation. The record states this interpretation explicitly. No formal Unity design or implementation file was changed during the ongoing mainline interview. |
| Verification Command | Targeted `rg` checks for U38, confirmed status, removed circle variants, all four native carriers, onboarding, degraded behavior, TD operator boundary, superseded Unity baseline, and the next gate; restricted-term scan over changed lines; `git diff --check`; final `git status --short`. |
| Residual Risk | Exact native phase animations, module timeline, degraded weather-progress policy, pretest thresholds, theory contrasts, revised test hierarchy, and revised sample size remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-04 Confirm Weather Breathing Module Baseline

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The Grill record promotes the four weather-breathing mappings from pending candidates to the confirmed research-design baseline without falsely marking untested runtime parameters as validated. |
| Actual Result | Added U37 and updated the blackboard. Confirmed Storm with 3-3-3-3 box breathing, Heat with 4-6 extended exhalation, Snow with 5-5 equal slow breathing, and Fade with cyclic sighing; retained passive participation, fixed-pair interpretation limits, pretest gates, versioned parameter changes, and the unresolved 90-120-second timeline. |
| Deviation / Surprise | None. The user's confirmation resolves the mapping decision, while comfort, device detectability, exact participant-facing instructions, and the unique runtime duration remain separate evidence gates. |
| Verification Command | Targeted `rg` checks for U37, confirmed status, all four mappings, superseded legacy designs, passive participation, fixed-pair interpretation limits, pretest gates, and the next decision; restricted-term scan over changed lines; `git diff --check`; final `git status --short`. |
| Residual Risk | The native scene cue versus common breathing-circle decision, exact 120-second timeline, pretest thresholds, low-degree-of-freedom theory contrast, revised test hierarchy, and revised sample size remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-04 Reconsider Weather Breathing Protocols From Evidence

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The Grill record first reflects the existing weather recovery mechanisms, then distinguishes supported breathing-protocol structures from project-specific weather mappings, proposes four measurable passive modules, and keeps the proposal unconfirmed. |
| Actual Result | Added U36 after reading the Unity visual handoff, scene design, seven-day plan, Unity framework, quality gates, and current weather controller evidence. Recorded a pending baseline of Storm with 3-3-3-3 box breathing, Heat with 4-6 extended exhalation, Snow with 5-5 equal slow breathing, and Fade with cyclic sighing. Updated the blackboard with evidence boundaries, visual-process integration, and comfort and device-detectability gates. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The evidence is strongest for slow pacing near six breaths per minute, while the independent advantage of longer exhalation remains inconsistent. Cyclic-sighing evidence uses five minutes per day for 28 days, so it does not validate a 120-second module. The weather pairings are design hypotheses rather than established natural correspondences. |
| Verification Command | Read-only project inspection; online primary-study and review checks; targeted `rg` checks for U36, all four weather mechanisms, all four candidate protocols, pending status, dose limits, and role boundaries; restricted-term scan over changed lines; URL reachability spot-check; `git diff --check`; final `git status --short`. |
| Residual Risk | Exact protocol parameters, the native in-scene guidance design, 120-second internal timeline, comfort rules, process-feature thresholds, theory contrasts, and revised sample size remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-04 Reduce Confirmatory Sequence Complexity

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The Grill record keeps balanced coverage of all 24 sequences and the 14-degree-of-freedom structured model for secondary analysis and policy learning, while moving the unique confirmatory question to a small set of theory-defined contrasts and invalidating the prior 480-valid-session figure as the current requirement. |
| Actual Result | Added U35 and updated the blackboard. The decision preserves all sequence and device data, demotes the 14-degree-of-freedom model from the primary test, and requires sample size to be recalculated after theory contrasts are frozen. Current module evidence was checked and found unresolved standardization and passive-experience conflicts. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The current weather design pairs Storm with 4-2-6 and Heat with 1:2 long exhalation, but Snow still includes micro-action and Fade uses autonomous breathing. The Unity scene document also retains the superseded TD-Spout dependency. Theory contrasts cannot be defensibly defined until these module contracts are redesigned. |
| Verification Command | Read-only inspection of `01-需求与设计/情绪天气方案/四种天气设计.md` and `02-技术研发/04-Unity视觉/场景设计.md`; targeted `rg` checks for U35, preserved 24-sequence coverage, demoted 14-degree-of-freedom model, prior sample-size boundary, module conflicts, and the updated next gate; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; final `git status --short`. |
| Residual Risk | The four breathing protocols, module theory dimensions, passive presentation rules, low-degree-of-freedom contrasts, revised test hierarchy, and revised sample size remain unconfirmed. The current Unity architecture document remains stale. |

### 2026-08-04 Confirm Effect Grid And Recruitment Allowance

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The Grill record fixes incremental `f2` scenarios at 0.02, 0.05, and 0.10, uses 0.05 for primary planning, reserves 15% for unusable sessions, and reports a reproducible preliminary sample-size approximation without presenting it as the final Monte Carlo result. |
| Actual Result | Added U34 and updated the blackboard. A noncentral-F calculation for 14 added sequence degrees of freedom, 15 full-model predictors, alpha 0.05, and 90% power produced valid/recruitment targets of 1176/1384, 480/565, and 264/311 for `f2` 0.02, 0.05, and 0.10 respectively. The main planning scenario exposes a large-scale recruitment requirement. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The confirmed 14-degree-of-freedom model requires about 480 valid sessions even at `f2=0.05`. This is far beyond the legacy 8-12 participant plan and creates a hard choice between recruitment capacity and confirmatory-model complexity. |
| Verification Command | `py -3.14 -c` noncentral-F power calculation using `scipy.stats.f` and `scipy.stats.ncf`; targeted `rg` checks for U34, the `f2` formula and scenarios, 15% allowance, all sample targets, approximation boundary, and the updated feasibility gate; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; final `git status --short`. |
| Residual Risk | The approximation assumes independent homoscedastic linear-model sessions and does not replace the planned Monte Carlo simulation. Recruitment capacity, final model complexity, nuisance ranges, full-rank implementation, and final sample size remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-04 Confirm Simulation-Based Power Standard

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The Grill record sets 90% target power for the global test, requires Monte Carlo simulation over the balanced 24-sequence full-rank design, limits pilot use to nuisance parameters, rounds valid samples to a multiple of 24, and distinguishes valid from recruited sample size. |
| Actual Result | Added U33 and updated the blackboard. A read-only rank calculation over all 24 permutations found 9 position degrees of freedom, 5 transition degrees of freedom incremental to position, and 14 total structured-sequence degrees of freedom for `MPT` versus `M0`; the record requires final simulation to use verified full-rank coding. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The visible 16 position and 12 directed-transition indicators do not contribute 21 independent sequence terms after permutation constraints. The actual structured model adds 14 degrees of freedom, so heuristic parameter counting would misstate power requirements. |
| Verification Command | `py -3.14 -c` rank calculation over all 24 permutations; targeted `rg` checks for U33, 90% power, Monte Carlo simulation, pilot restrictions, multiples of 24, unusable-session allowance, and 9/5/14 degrees of freedom; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; final `git status --short`. |
| Residual Risk | Full-rank contrast implementation, minimum-effect scale and grid, nuisance-parameter ranges, unusable-session allowance, simulation code, random seeds, convergence criteria, and final sample size remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-04 Confirm Hierarchical Sequence Testing

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The Grill record defines one global primary comparison of the baseline-adjusted position-plus-transition model against the baseline-only model, gates family and coefficient interpretation, applies Holm correction, and preserves 24-sequence estimates outside the primary significance family. |
| Actual Result | Added U32, defined `M0`, `MP`, and `MPT`, froze the global `MPT` versus `M0` test at two-sided alpha 0.05, gated Holm-adjusted position and transition family tests and coefficient interpretation, and required non-gated results to remain exploratory. Updated the blackboard and moved the next gate to power-design standards. |
| Deviation / Surprise | Multiplicity and interpretation hierarchy are now fixed, but model-matrix rank, estimator behavior, and power assumptions still cannot be evaluated until the exact feature coding and simulation inputs are defined. |
| Verification Command | Targeted `rg` checks for U32, `M0`/`MP`/`MPT`, the unique global test, alpha 0.05, Holm-gated family and coefficient tests, 24-sequence status, exploration boundary, and the updated next gate; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; final `git status --short`. |
| Residual Risk | Full-rank feature coding, estimator choice, residual assumptions, robust inference, minimum effect, baseline correlation, target power, attrition allowance, and sample size remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-04 Confirm Structured Sequence Analysis Hierarchy

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The Grill record makes module-position and directed-transition effects the primary structured analysis, retains adjusted estimates and ranking stability for all 24 complete sequences as secondary analysis, and reserves adaptive-policy value for independent confirmation. |
| Actual Result | Added U31, froze the four-level evidence hierarchy, prohibited naive winner claims from raw sequence means, retained all 24 sequence reports with uncertainty, and moved the next gate to one joint primary hypothesis and coefficient-testing hierarchy. Updated the blackboard accordingly. |
| Deviation / Surprise | Sequence representation is now prioritized, but the position and transition terms still form a correlated multi-parameter family. A joint hypothesis and multiplicity plan are required before power analysis. |
| Verification Command | Targeted `rg` checks for U31, primary position and transition analysis, all 24 adjusted sequence estimates, ranking stability, strategy learning, independent confirmation, and the updated next gate; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; final `git status --short`. |
| Residual Risk | Feature coding, model rank, joint hypothesis, coefficient hierarchy, multiplicity method, regularization, ranking stability method, power inputs, and sample size remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-04 Confirm Primary Sequence Estimand

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The Grill record defines `delta_NA = NA_pre - NA_post` with positive values indicating reduction, uses baseline-adjusted post-session negative affect for primary sequence inference, and distinguishes randomized order effects from unadjusted whole-experience change. |
| Actual Result | Added U30, froze the score direction and `NA_post ~ NA_pre + prespecified randomized-sequence features` model, assigned raw change to description and sensitivity analysis, and recorded the causal-interpretation boundary. Updated the blackboard and moved the next gate to sequence representation. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The primary affect outcome is now operationally defined, but the sequence term is still a placeholder. Sample size cannot be calculated until the 24-level sequence, position, and transition terms are prioritized. |
| Verification Command | Targeted `rg` checks for U30, the score equation and direction, baseline-adjusted model, descriptive-versus-primary roles, causal boundary, and the updated next gate; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; final `git status --short`. |
| Residual Risk | Sequence representation, covariate set, model family, missing-item rule, residual assumptions, multiplicity control, power inputs, and sample size remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-04 Adopt Chinese 20-Item PANAS

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The Grill record adopts a validated Chinese 20-item PANAS with an immediate-state timeframe, assigns the 10-item negative-affect subscale as the unique primary scale outcome, and preserves source, version, scoring, and permission checks as implementation gates. |
| Actual Result | Added U29, froze identical pre/post “right now” administration, kept positive affect and SAM dimensions secondary, excluded device data from PANAS scoring, and moved the next decision gate to the primary estimand and score direction. Updated the blackboard accordingly. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The methodological instrument choice is confirmed, but the exact Chinese item source and permission have not yet been verified. The record therefore distinguishes adoption from implementation readiness. |
| Verification Command | Targeted `rg` checks for U29, 20 items, immediate-state timeframe, 10-item negative-affect primary status, secondary outcomes, implementation gates, and the updated next gate; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; final `git status --short`. |
| Residual Risk | Exact Chinese wording, source and permission, score range, missing-item rule, change direction, primary estimand, and sensitivity assumptions remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-04 Confirm Primary Scale Construct

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The Grill record identifies state negative-affect change as the unique primary scale construct, keeps SAM dimensions and positive affect secondary, and leaves the exact standardized instrument and score formula for the next decision gate. |
| Actual Result | Added U28, separated the primary construct from SAM valence/arousal/control dimensions and device-process evidence, and updated the blackboard so instrument version, items, response timeframe, direction, and change-score formula remain explicitly unfrozen. |
| Deviation / Surprise | Existing project gates mention SAM, but the redesigned main outcome is narrower and requires a direct state negative-affect score. SAM remains potentially useful as a secondary dimensional measure. |
| Verification Command | Targeted `rg` checks for U28, the unique primary construct, secondary SAM dimensions, unfrozen instrument details, and the updated next gate; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; final `git status --short`. |
| Residual Risk | Instrument choice, Chinese version provenance and permission, item wording, administration timeframe, score direction, change-score formula, and sensitivity assumptions remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-04 Confirm Separate Outcome And Process Models

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The Grill record assigns pre/post scale change to session-level sequence analysis and real-device records to segment-level composite-module process analysis, connects them without creating a synthetic total score, and does not claim an independently identified breathing-method effect. |
| Actual Result | Added U27, froze the outcome/process model boundary, required repeated-measures controls for segment analysis, retained device features as adaptive-policy inputs and explanatory evidence, and moved the next gate to selecting the exact standardized scale score. Updated the blackboard accordingly. |
| Deviation / Surprise | Existing project material mentions SAM, but the redesigned study has not established that SAM provides the intended unique short-term negative-emotion score. The instrument remains deliberately unfrozen. |
| Verification Command | Targeted `rg` checks for U27, both model levels, the no-synthetic-score rule, fixed-pair identification boundary, and the updated next gate; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; final `git status --short`. |
| Residual Risk | The exact scale, primary subscale, score direction, process feature family, missing-data rules, sample size, and statistical models remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-04 Confirm Three-Stage Sequence Evidence Chain

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The Grill record distinguishes balanced random exploration, strategy learning, and independent confirmation; the first stage assigns all 24 complete sequences independently of real-time device data, while later adaptive selection remains separately testable. |
| Actual Result | Added U26, recorded pre-scale stratification with `1/24` sequence allocation, limited first-stage real-time device use to data capture and within-scene feedback, required policy freezing before independent confirmation, and retained balanced random assignment as the minimum comparison benchmark. Updated the blackboard to make the revised phase boundary current. |
| Deviation / Surprise | U24-U25 previously described state-constrained micro-random selection during exploration. U26 supersedes that first-stage mechanism but preserves adaptive selection for the independent confirmation stage. |
| Verification Command | Targeted `rg` checks for U26, `1/24`, all three phases, the supersession statement, policy freezing, and the next gate; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; final `git status --short`. |
| Residual Risk | The unique primary outcome, sample size, exact pre-scale strata, stage-three comparison conditions, policy form, and formal analysis model remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-04 Confirm Micro-Randomized Adaptive Sequence Core

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The Grill record marks adaptive sequence generation and constrained random exploration as confirmed, explains why naive realized-sequence averages are biased, and leaves only the primary outcome definition as the next mainline gate. |
| Actual Result | Added U24-U25, froze the main paper direction as causal evaluation and explainable adaptive optimization of weather-breathing sequences, recorded nonzero random choice probabilities and required decision logs, and defined discovery, policy learning, and independent confirmation phases. Updated the blackboard to identify the primary outcome as the next gate. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The user wants both personalized real-time sequencing and estimates for all 24 complete sequences. Supporting both requires constrained exploration and propensity logging; a deterministic policy alone cannot identify all sequence effects. |
| Verification Command | Targeted `rg` checks for U24-U25, confirmed status, nonzero random probabilities, three research phases, working title, and next gate; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; final `git status --short`. |
| Residual Risk | The primary outcome, module pairings, randomization probabilities, quality constraints, sample simulation, and final comparison arms remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-04 Confirm Ideal Output Portfolio

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The Grill record preserves all discussion after U16 and marks the user-confirmed ideal output portfolio as the current baseline without treating external acceptance or grants as guaranteed. |
| Actual Result | Appended U17-U23, covering fixed weather-breathing pairs, 24 sequence clarification, publication-quality assessment, three low-increment paper routes, real-device-only formal data, the distinction between ideal redesign and current evidence, and the confirmed output portfolio. Updated the blackboard so the next gate is selecting one primary paper contribution. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The later fixed-pair sequence direction supersedes the earlier independent 4×4 scene-breathing proposal. The main paper contribution remains unresolved among live-versus-replay, fixed sequence modeling, and explainable adaptive sequencing. |
| Verification Command | Targeted `rg` checks for U17-U23, confirmed output categories, superseded 4×4 status, real-device boundary, and the next gate; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; final `git status --short`. |
| Residual Risk | The portfolio is a target baseline. Journal acceptance, showcase acceptance, software registration completion, and patent grant depend on external review and cannot be guaranteed. |

### 2026-08-04 Grill Interview Context Preservation

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The project contains a dated, navigable record of the continuous Grill discussion, clearly separating original user inputs, confirmed decisions, superseded ideas, evidence-based rationale, pending recommendations, open questions, and the next interview gate. |
| Actual Result | Added `00-项目管理/看板与进度/2026-08-04_Grill访谈原始总结与决策演化.md`; linked it from the M00 README; updated the project-local blackboard. The record preserves the evolution from module boundaries through Unity/TD separation, passive four-scene flow, overall outcome evidence, and the proposed 4×4 scene-breathing match design. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The current module map still describes TD Spout as a Unity input, while the later confirmed target makes Unity independent of TD. This discrepancy is recorded for a future architecture update after the research mainline is confirmed, not changed in this preservation task. |
| Verification Command | Targeted `rg` checks for required decisions, decision-state labels, restricted terms, and the M00 navigation link; Markdown relative-link check; `git diff --check`; final `git status --short`. |
| Residual Risk | Assistant replies before the latest turn are preserved as decision summaries rather than a byte-for-byte transcript. The proposed 4×4 design, scene-level verbal ratings, comparison condition, and four standardized breathing conditions remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-04 Project Module Reorganization

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The D-drive repository has one authoritative module map, stable entry pages for each top-level module group, no active references to the old C-drive path or user-deleted evidence files, and unchanged Python behavior. |
| Actual Result | Added `PROJECT_MODULES.md` with M00-M10 responsibilities, interfaces, dependencies, placement rules, and validation entry points. Added entry pages for project management, experience design, verification evidence, and delivery. Updated root, development, runbook, board, and workflow navigation. Python tests passed: 42 passed. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The worktree also contained a user modification to `CLAUDE.md`, an untracked `SRP/` asset directory, and a root docx duplicate. The duplicate docx hash matches the copy under project management; all of these pre-existing changes were preserved and excluded from this task. |
| Verification Command | `py -3.14 -m pytest '02-技术研发/01-数据采集/tests' '02-技术研发/02-信号处理/tests' '02-技术研发/05-通信协议/tests' '02-技术研发/tests' -q`; targeted `rg` scans for old paths, deleted entries, and restricted terms; relative Markdown link check; `git diff --check`. |
| Residual Risk | TD, Spout, and Unity Play Mode were not launched in this documentation-only task. User-deleted verification materials remain absent, so module M08 records structure and evidence requirements but not a completed full-system verification. |

### 2026-07-01 Project File and Document Cleanup

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | Outdated entry docs are updated, ignored temporary artifacts are removed, authoritative protocol references point to `UDP字段冻结_v1.2.md`, and Python tests still pass. |
| Actual Result | Updated AGENTS, CLAUDE, README, current board, development plan, UDP docs, TD bridge comment, cleanup record, data README, and blackboard. Removed caches, old zip backups, mock CSV, duplicate reference zip, and garbled Unity/MCP runtime mirror. Python 3.14.4 tests passed: 42 passed. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The previous `.hermes-venv` interpreter no longer exists; `py -3.14` is the current valid Python entry. |
| Verification Command | `py -3.14 -m pytest '02-技术研发/01-数据采集/tests' '02-技术研发/02-信号处理/tests' '02-技术研发/05-通信协议/tests' '02-技术研发/tests' -q`; `rg` consistency scans; `git diff --check`; targeted `Test-Path` checks for removed artifacts. |
| Residual Risk | Unity generated cache directories remain intentionally preserved to avoid slow reimport; stage 6/7 evidence materials still need to be populated under `04-成果与交付/`. |

### 2026-06-24 Enable SAPIEN-Lite Workflow

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | `AGENTS.md` contains an appended `Codex Workflow` section; `work/` contains blackboard, verification log, and evaluation harness templates. |
| Actual Result | All three workflow files exist; `AGENTS.md` contains `Codex Workflow`; templates contain the required blackboard, verification, and 30-task harness sections. |
| Deviation / Surprise | `git diff --stat` only showed tracked files before staging; untracked `work/` files are expected to appear in `git status`. |
| Verification Command | `Test-Path work/codex-blackboard.md`; `Test-Path work/codex-verification-log.md`; `Test-Path work/codex-evaluation-harness.md`; `rg -n "Codex Workflow|Current Task Goal|Expected Observation|30-Task Log|High-Risk Action Intercepted" AGENTS.md work` |
| Residual Risk | Workflow quality depends on future tasks consistently updating the blackboard and verification log. |

### 2026-08-05 Import And Reassess IJHCI Planning Package

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The imported package is preserved as a candidate planning baseline, its original source is hash-auditable, confirmed user decisions are separated from package-generated freezes, and the next mainline decision is explicit. |
| Actual Result | Copied 137 source files into `00-项目管理/01-项目章程与规划/2026-08-05_SRP_IJHCI_全项目1-12步规划设计包_v1.0` without deleting Downloads. Added import provenance, original SHA-256 inventory, a synchronous reading ledger, and a clean reassessment summary. Corrected the Unity build eligibility values and a routing-validator boundary phrase. |
| Verification Command | Source/destination relative-path and SHA-256 comparison; `py -3.14 2026-08-05_SRP_IJHCI_power_sensitivity.py --output-dir C:\tmp\srp-power-recheck --repetitions 3000`; `py -3.14 tools\validate_ethics_pack.py`; `py -3.14 tools\validate_routing_pack.py`; restricted Chinese/English terminology scan; project pytest and Git checks at task close. |
| Deviation / Surprise | U41 proves the imported claim/comparator/power freezes were not user-confirmed. The fourth-step validator cannot currently import `jsonschema`, and the package does not declare that dependency. |
| Residual Risk | The recommended split-paper mainline, abstract comparator, gated outcomes, crossover design, SCCI role, non-inferiority margin, and 104-person recruitment plan remain proposals until the user confirms them and later external gates pass. |

### 2026-08-05 Merge Two Contributions Into One IJHCI Paper

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The reassessment records one IJHCI paper with two explicitly ranked contributions, supersedes the split-paper recommendation, and exposes one new confirmation gate before task decomposition. |
| Actual Result | Recorded the user's one-paper decision. Recommended scene-native breathing prompts as the primary confirmatory contribution and explainable sequence orchestration as a secondary explanatory contribution based on balanced order, position, predecessor, transition, and interaction-state-estimation analyses. |
| Verification Command | Targeted `git diff`; restricted-term scan over the two reassessment documents and project blackboard; `git diff --check`; final `git status --short`. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The user's message used `IJHCL`; project history and package naming consistently use `IJHCI`, so the record retains `IJHCI` pending any explicit venue change. |
| Residual Risk | The primary-secondary ranking, comparator, outcome gates, crossover design, and sample size remain unconfirmed. The single-paper design cannot claim a globally best sequence or a learned policy without stronger independent evidence. |

### 2026-08-05 Confirm IJHCI Contribution Hierarchy

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The recommended contribution hierarchy is promoted to a user-confirmed baseline, the closed gate is retained audibly, and exactly one next decision is exposed. |
| Actual Result | Confirmed scene-native breathing prompts as the primary contribution and explainable sequence orchestration as the secondary contribution in one IJHCI paper. Advanced the next gate to whether `abstract_pacer` remains the required comparator. |
| Verification Command | Targeted confirmation-state search; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; project Python tests; final `git status --short`. |
| Deviation / Surprise | None. |
| Residual Risk | Comparator, outcome gates, crossover design, and sample size remain unconfirmed. Team task decomposition remains intentionally blocked by the research-design gate. |

### 2026-08-05 Confirm Abstract Pacer Weather Behavior

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The comparator keeps an equivalent closed-loop weather response while removing weather-based respiratory-phase encoding, so the main comparison changes only the guidance carrier. |
| Actual Result | Confirmed `abstract_pacer` as the comparator. The abstract circle carries target rhythm and real-time phase feedback; weather keeps matched macro response but cannot encode respiratory phase. Other experience and data factors remain matched. |
| Verification Command | Targeted comparator-boundary search; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; project Python tests; final `git status --short`. |
| Deviation / Surprise | None. |
| Residual Risk | The two-visit crossover, outcome gates, and sample size remain unconfirmed. Macro-response equivalence still needs a measurable implementation contract before development. |

### 2026-08-05 Reject Repeat Participation And Crossover

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The crossover proposal is explicitly rejected because the first exposure can alter the second-visit baseline; paired-power numbers are invalidated and not silently reused. |
| Actual Result | Froze a one-formal-session-per-participant constraint. Marked the two-visit crossover, 88 effective pairs, 104 participants, and 208 visits as inapplicable. Proposed a 1:1 parallel-group design with 24-order balance inside each condition as the next gate. |
| Verification Command | Targeted stale-design search; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; project Python tests; final `git status --short`. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The imported power script only supports the rejected paired design, so it cannot be reused to size the proposed parallel groups. |
| Residual Risk | Parallel-group allocation, adjusted outcome model, minimum effect of interest, order-balance granularity, attrition reserve, and total sample size remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-05 Audit Stage-Specific Weather Order Requirements

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | Original confirmed stage rules, later package rewrites, and current one-paper constraints are separated before selecting an allocation design. |
| Actual Result | Recovered the confirmed three-stage chain: 24-order balanced exploration independent of live state; offline strategy learning and freeze without new allocation; independent new-participant comparison of frozen policy against the 24-order balanced baseline. Identified the later four-sequence Williams plan as dependent on the now-rejected split-paper premise. |
| Verification Command | Package-wide targeted search; contextual reads of the original Grill record, top-level design summary, construct freeze, lifecycle overview, and sequence research files; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; project Python tests. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The package contains two incompatible order plans because it preserves both the original three-stage contribution design and a later feasibility rewrite that removed sequence orchestration from the first paper. |
| Residual Risk | The recommended mapping of the abstract comparator into stage one and the frozen-policy comparison into stage three is not yet user-confirmed. Sample-size multiples are allocation constraints, not powered sample-size results. |

### 2026-08-05 Confirm Three-Stage One-Paper Design

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The stage mapping is promoted from recommendation to user-confirmed authority without turning allocation multiples into sample-size claims. |
| Actual Result | Confirmed stage one as the abstract-pacer comparison plus balanced 24-order exploration, stage two as offline strategy learning and freeze from scene-native data, and stage three as an independent new-participant comparison of the frozen scene-native policy against the scene-native balanced-random baseline. |
| Verification Command | Targeted decision-state search; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; project Python tests; staged-scope audit; final `git status --short`. |
| Deviation / Surprise | Initial approval checks were interrupted twice by the approval-service connection before a later authorized read-only status check succeeded. |
| Residual Risk | Stage-one outcome gates, effect thresholds, measurement instruments, power assumptions, and all stage-specific sample sizes remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-05 Confirm Ordered Stage-One Outcome Gates

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The ordered two-gate claim becomes user-confirmed while candidate cycle tolerances, non-inferiority margin, semantic-congruence instrument, paired power, and obsolete sample size remain unfrozen. |
| Actual Result | Confirmed Gate 1 as non-inferior respiratory execution quality and Gate 2 as superior scene-prompt semantic congruence, with Gate 2 confirmatory only after Gate 1 passes. |
| Verification Command | Targeted gate-state search; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; project Python tests; staged-scope audit; final `git status --short`. |
| Deviation / Surprise | Existing Gate 1 power tables assume the rejected paired design and cannot size the confirmed parallel stage-one design. |
| Residual Risk | The primary device outcome definition, module-specific cycle tolerances, non-inferiority margin, Gate 2 instrument, power assumptions, and sample size remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-05 Confirm Flexible Module Duration Ranges

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The 120-second module is superseded by an evidence-informed target with narrow planning ranges, while formal exposure remains fixed within a study stage. |
| Actual Result | Confirmed targets of 25 seconds demo, 150 seconds closed loop, and 25 seconds transition, with allowed design ranges of 24-30, 140-160, and 20-30 seconds. Formal builds must freeze exact values and match both comparator conditions. |
| Verification Command | Targeted active-duration search; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; project Python tests; staged-scope audit; final `git status --short`. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The former 120-second baseline appeared in multiple current blackboard bullets and required explicit supersession rather than an appended note alone. |
| Residual Risk | The final fixed values still depend on technical pretesting. Stage-level frequency-domain HRV interpretation may require a longer window and is not justified by the duration decision alone. |

### 2026-08-06 Confirm Protocol Fidelity As Gate-One Outcome

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | `protocol_fidelity` is promoted to the sole primary device-derived Gate 1 outcome while thresholds, missingness, aggregation, margin, and sample size remain explicitly unfrozen. |
| Actual Result | Confirmed the proportion of evaluable cycles meeting preregistered module-specific structure and timing tolerance within the frozen closed-loop window. Validly recorded nonconforming cycles remain failures rather than exclusions. |
| Verification Command | Targeted decision-state and stale-status search; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; project Python tests; staged-scope audit; final `git status --short`. |
| Deviation / Surprise | Historical blackboard entries still described the outcome as unconfirmed and required explicit temporal qualification. |
| Residual Risk | Module-specific tolerance, technical non-evaluability rules, four-module aggregation, non-inferiority margin, parallel-group power, and stage-one sample size remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-06 Confirm Equal-Weight Four-Module Aggregation

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | Each fixed weather-breathing module contributes equally to the participant-level Gate 1 outcome, independent of its number of cycles. |
| Actual Result | Confirmed per-module `protocol_fidelity` followed by an equal-weight mean, with each module contributing 25%. Direct pooling of all cycles is prohibited; module-specific results are prespecified secondary analyses. |
| Verification Command | Targeted aggregation-state search; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; project Python tests; staged-scope audit; final `git status --short`. |
| Deviation / Surprise | None. |
| Residual Risk | Handling of a non-evaluable module, analysis sets, missing-data sensitivity, module-specific tolerance, non-inferiority margin, parallel-group power, and sample size remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-06 Confirm Complete Four-Module Outcome Requirement

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | A participant-level equal-weight Gate 1 result is never reconstructed from a different subset of modules when one module is non-evaluable. |
| Actual Result | Confirmed that any non-evaluable module makes the participant-level four-module Gate 1 result missing. Remaining modules cannot be re-averaged as a substitute; analysis-set and sensitivity handling must be preregistered. |
| Verification Command | Targeted completeness-state search; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; project Python tests; staged-scope audit; final `git status --short`. |
| Deviation / Surprise | None. |
| Residual Risk | Technical non-evaluability criteria, missing-data models, analysis-set algorithms, module-specific tolerance, non-inferiority margin, power, and sample size remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-06 Confirm Blinded Technical Non-Evaluability Boundary

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | Non-evaluability is limited to preregistered technical failures and cannot absorb validly recorded execution failures or depend on condition and later outcomes. |
| Actual Result | Confirmed technical-only reasons, blinded determination, frozen rules and versions, and auditable reason codes. Updated the active offline formula from pooled cycles to the confirmed equal-weight complete-four-module outcome. |
| Verification Command | Targeted non-evaluability and formula search; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; project Python tests; staged-scope audit; final `git status --short`. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The active offline design still used the older pooled-cycle formula and required direct reconciliation with the confirmed aggregation decision. |
| Residual Risk | Signal-coverage threshold, module-specific minimum analyzable cycles, event-detection validation, missing-data models, non-inferiority margin, power, and sample size remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-06 Confirm Dual Module-Evaluability Gates

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | A module is evaluable only when both synchronized valid-signal coverage and module-specific analyzable-cycle count meet thresholds frozen before formal data collection. |
| Actual Result | Confirmed the two-gate structure and its propagation to the complete-four-module outcome. Numeric thresholds remain technical-pretest outputs and cannot be relaxed after formal data are available. |
| Verification Command | Targeted evaluability-gate search; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; project Python tests; staged-scope audit; final `git status --short`. |
| Deviation / Surprise | None. |
| Residual Risk | Numeric coverage and cycle-count thresholds, cycle-conformance tolerances, event-detection validation, missing-data models, non-inferiority margin, power, and sample size remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-06 Confirm Structure-First Module-Specific Cycle Rules

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | A recorded cycle must first satisfy its module's required event structure and then its module-specific timing tolerances; candidate global percentages remain pretest inputs only. |
| Actual Result | Confirmed structure-first, module-specific cycle conformance. The 25% phase-error and 20% total-cycle-error values remain technical-pretest starting points rather than formal thresholds. |
| Verification Command | Targeted cycle-rule search; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; project Python tests; staged-scope audit; final `git status --short`. |
| Deviation / Surprise | None. |
| Residual Risk | Numeric structure and timing tolerances, event-detection validation, missing-data models, non-inferiority margin, power, and sample size remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-06 Select 7.5-Point Non-Inferiority Margin

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The delegated margin decision freezes one confirmatory absolute-difference threshold, preserves stricter sensitivity analysis, and prevents the historical 10-point candidate from being treated as current. |
| Actual Result | Set `Delta_NI=0.075` for `scene_native - abstract_pacer`; Gate 1 requires the lower bound of a two-sided 95% confidence interval to exceed `-0.075`. Reserved 0.05 for strict sensitivity and 0.10 for descriptive worst-case display only. |
| Verification Command | Targeted decision-state and supersession search; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; project Python tests; staged-scope audit; final `git status --short`. |
| Deviation / Surprise | Historical execution materials contain a frozen 10-point candidate. They remain preserved as historical evidence and are explicitly superseded in current control documents. |
| Residual Risk | Analysis-set algorithms, conservative missing-data handling, numeric module thresholds, parallel-group power, and stage-one sample size remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-06 Require Concordant Gate-One Analysis Sets

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | Gate 1 cannot pass by selecting the more favorable result from the full analysis set or the complete-four-module set. |
| Actual Result | Froze the full analysis set as primary and the technically evaluable complete-four-module set as supportive. Both lower 95% confidence bounds must exceed `-0.075`; otherwise Gate 1 fails and Gate 2 becomes exploratory. Point-estimate disagreement triggers a prespecified bias audit without changing the success rule after results are known. |
| Verification Command | Targeted analysis-set and gate-state search; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; project Python tests; staged-scope audit; final `git status --short`. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The complete-four-module set must not be mislabeled as a conventional per-protocol set because valid nonconforming cycles remain failures and only blinded technical evaluability defines inclusion. |
| Residual Risk | The full-analysis-set imputation model, adverse-shift grid, tipping-point rule, numeric module thresholds, parallel-group power, and stage-one sample size remain unconfirmed. |

### 2026-08-06 Close Internal Research And Statistical Gates

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | One implementation authority resolves the remaining internal research decisions without presenting external approvals or technical-pretest outputs as complete. |
| Actual Result | Added a single-paper three-gate hierarchy, bounded multiple imputation with adverse-shift sensitivity, SCCI fitness gates, stage-one and stage-three planning anchors, a frozen interpretable stochastic policy, and technical-pretest output rules. Superseded crossover, PPS, 120-second, minus-0.10, and separate-paper semantics in active analysis documents. |
| Verification Command | Run `08_sample_size_anchors.py`; targeted current-state and stale-conflict search; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; project Python tests; staged-scope audit; final `git status --short`. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The active lifecycle, product, QC, model, sequence, and module-map entries contained mutually incompatible historical designs. A precedence document was required before safe task dispatch. |
| Residual Risk | Engineering interfaces and task packages still need synchronization. External approvals, device availability, PANAS rights, and Level A/B/C evidence remain open and cannot be closed by repository edits. |

### 2026-08-06 Freeze Target Modules And Dispatch Task Tree

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | Four people can independently claim non-overlapping first-wave packages while every downstream package has explicit dependencies, 1-5 day scope, acceptance evidence, and external-gate semantics. |
| Actual Result | Replaced the legacy Spout-centered module map with the Python-authoritative, Unity-independent, TD-read-only target. Added the v2 runtime contract, 37 task packages, a CSV registry, interface acceptance matrix, and dependency validator. Exactly F-01 through F-04 are READY. Updated README, AGENTS, product timing, lifecycle, and the current board. |
| Verification Command | Task-registry validation with cycle detection; sample-anchor reconstruction; entry-link existence checks; target-state search; restricted-term scan; `git diff --check`; 42 project Python tests; staged-scope audit; final local/remote SHA check. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The root README and current board still presented the 10Hz UDP/Spout prototype and stage-7 archival work as current. They required explicit migration-only labeling before dispatch. |
| Residual Risk | The existing code and Unity/TD artifacts remain legacy implementation until claimed packages replace them. Hardware, approvals, PANAS rights, Level A/B/C, and formal research evidence remain external gates. |

### 2026-08-06 Upgrade Task Packages With Bidirectional Coverage

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | Every claimable task has an explicit domain title, four-stage process, objective acceptance criteria, required evidence, implementer skills, domestic Chinese learning links, and a downstream path into the complete project. |
| Actual Result | Audited the original 37 packages from both directions and found missing lifecycle work plus oversized participant-run packages. Replaced the active registry with 48 fixed packages and three repeatable batch templates. Added deterministic handbook rendering, a learning-resource catalog, a reverse-coverage matrix, final-paper/delivery tasks, governance and preregistration tasks, locked-analysis tasks, Unity product consistency, and batch closeout semantics. |
| Verification Command | Run `10_render_task_handbook.py`; run upgraded `07_validate_task_packages.py`; verify 51 entries, 48 fixed, three templates, four READY, no cycle, valid domain/process/learning/acceptance/evidence fields, and reachability to W-04; check learning URLs; run restricted-term scan, Markdown-link check, Python tests, `git diff --check`, staged-scope audit, and final local/remote SHA check. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The original task tree covered engineering startup well but compressed Level C and formal stages into impossible single five-day packages and did not create tasks for locked analysis, the manuscript, submission, or project handoff. |
| Residual Risk | Learning portals may change and must be rechecked at claim time. All hardware, approval, Level, preregistration, lock, analysis-result, submission, and external-recognition gates remain open until their real evidence exists. |

### 2026-08-06 Generate Math-Modeling PDF Briefs

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | Three self-contained A4 PDF briefs follow the math-modeling paper structure, faithfully summarize the current frozen design, and remain reproducible from project-owned sources. |
| Actual Result | Generated project-goal and feasibility (5 pages, SHA-256 `A1BD6D17...F0DBE0C1`), fixed-task overview (8 pages, `72BAF1F0...FA2E24D8`), and project-design and experiment-flow (7 pages, `41876993...C8A43FB2`) PDFs. Added deterministic figure generation, a Windows PowerShell 5 compatible one-command build, artifact verification, and delivery navigation. The scoped Python regression completed with `42 passed in 2.59s`. |
| Verification Command | Run `build_briefs.ps1`; run `verify_briefs.py`; render every page with Poppler and inspect contact sheets; scan sources and extracted text for restricted terminology; run project Python tests; run `git diff --check`; audit staged scope. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The initial first brief left references alone on a sixth page, and two task-wave headings were weakly placed. Source pagination was adjusted before final verification. |
| Residual Risk | The briefs describe the frozen target design, not completed hardware, Level, formal-stage, statistical-result, submission, or external-recognition evidence. |

### 2026-08-06 Audit IJHCI Contribution Viability

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The contribution argument distinguishes journal scope from novelty, separates primary and secondary claims, compares the design with closest HCI work, and produces falsifiable submission gates. |
| Actual Result | Rated the current design `CONDITIONAL_GO` at 73/100 design maturity. Preserved scene-native representation as the primary contribution, demoted sequence orchestration to a conditional secondary contribution, unified both through two interaction timescales, and identified seven non-compensating contribution gates. |
| Verification Command | Cross-check against IJHCI official scope and relevant IJHCI/HCI papers; restricted-term scan; Markdown-link syntax check; `git diff --check`; scoped project Python regression; staged-scope audit; local and remote SHA comparison. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The existing core claim was already stronger than a simple project-effect narrative, but the paper outline still referenced an obsolete two-day design and did not state the primary-secondary hierarchy. |
| Residual Risk | Novelty remains conditional on actual cross-structure design grammar, comparator equivalence, SCCI fitness, Gate 1-3 results, transferable design principles, and independent policy evidence. |

### 2026-08-06 Upgrade IJHCI Topic Across Project Authorities

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The upgrade strengthens one paper across theory, interaction design, comparator validity, measurement, statistics, adaptive orchestration, engineering, accessibility, openness and delivery without adding participant arms or breaking task ownership. |
| Actual Result | Added an authoritative ten-dimension upgrade addendum and U1-U8 non-compensating gates; updated the paper structure, project-paper map, risk/evidence authorities and 2026-2028 plan; strengthened 16 existing task packages without increasing the 48 fixed tasks and three templates; preserved exactly F-01 through F-04 as READY. The feasibility gate now budgets up to 528 participant sessions, about 352 single-station hours, and uses February 2028 as the conservative submission baseline unless verified parallel capacity supports an earlier date. |
| Verification Command | Task registry validator passed with 51 entries, 48 fixed tasks, three templates, four READY tasks and W-04 as terminal; 42 scoped Python tests passed; all 18 changed Markdown files resolved local links; terminology and superseded-design scans passed; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed. PDF verification passed at 5/8/7 pages with SHA-256 `85125E4F...31BDA`, `65B09F89...32373`, `C9F87242...E741`; all 20 pages kept extracted text within page bounds. Finish with staged-scope audit and local/remote SHA comparison. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The project-paper integration table still contained the obsolete 8-minute experience, FAS/PPS terminology and separate future-paper framing for sequence orchestration; these were synchronized with the active baseline. |
| Residual Risk | Documentation and task ACs do not close U1-U8, Level A/B/C or Gate 1-3. The 528-session capacity, additional measures, thresholds and public materials remain candidates until assigned tasks and external gates close them. |

### 2026-08-06 Independent IJHCI Reviewer Attack And v1.1 Upgrade

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | Independent attacks expose non-compensating paper, method and implementation weaknesses; every sustained objection maps to an executable authority, task acceptance condition or explicit downgrade rule. |
| Actual Result | Three isolated read-only model reviewer roles converged on `REJECT_AND_RESUBMIT_DESIGN`. Added the v1.1 adjudication and JSON authority; demoted SCCI to manipulation check; made Gate 2 joint; changed PF to expected opportunities; froze participant-grouped OPE/ESS/support; required the same Stage 3 Unity build; fixed questionnaire timing, randomization custody, repeat-participation deduplication and 484-616 station-hour capacity; upgraded control, experiment, product, runtime, analysis, task, paper and PDF files. The exercise is explicitly not external human peer review. |
| Verification Command | `py -3.14 -m py_compile` on five changed Python authorities; task validator; protocol v1.1 validator; `py -3.14 -m pytest ... -q`; PDF one-command build and `verify_briefs.py`; 21-page visual rendering; PDF glyph-bounds check; restricted-term scan; changed-Markdown local-link check; stale-authority scan; `git diff --check`; staged-scope and local/remote SHA checks. |
| Verified Evidence | Task registry `PASS` with 51 entries, 48 fixed, three templates, F-01 through F-04 `READY` and W-04 terminal. Protocol firewall `PASS`. Python regression `42 passed in 3.09s`. PDF verification `PASS` at 6/8/7 pages with SHA-256 prefixes `9EBF0394`, `181ABEB`, `B17F8C11`; all 21 pages and 12,333 glyphs stayed within bounds and visual inspection found no blank, cropped or overlapping page. Restricted terms were absent from 52 changed text files at that checkpoint; 18 local links resolved across 40 changed Markdown files. |
| Deviation / Surprise | Two earlier control drafts still carried old thresholds and active-looking status labels; both were preserved but marked `SUPERSEDED_FOR_EXECUTION`. The previous 352-hour estimate excluded setup and turnover, so the current capacity anchor is 484-616 station-hours. |
| Residual Risk | No real-device LIVE_E2E, external display latency, Level A/B/C, Monte Carlo sample-size result, two-week throughput, formal participant data, Gate 1-3 result, external review or publication outcome exists yet. |

### 2026-08-06 Complete F-02 Candidate Measurement Package

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | F-02 has a repository-owned candidate package satisfying AC1-AC3, unusable external references are excluded, status transitions are dependency-safe, and no Level or Gate result is overstated. |
| Actual Result | Added the F-02 package, AC record and专项 validator; marked F-02 `DONE`; unlocked only G-01 and R-01; regenerated the task handbook; synchronized project entry points and the current board. |
| Verified Evidence | F-02 validator `PASS` with 12 required item IDs; task validator `PASS` with 51 entries, 48 fixed, three templates, `DONE=F-02`, five READY tasks and W-04 terminal; protocol firewall `PASS`; `py_compile` passed; scoped Python regression `42 passed in 7.86s`; 18 local Markdown links resolved; restricted terminology absent from nine changed project documents. |
| Deviation / Surprise | Unfiltered root `pytest` collected vendored TouchDesigner OpenAPI tests and stopped because their separate `connexion` dependency is absent. The established project scope passed after excluding `02-技术研发/03-TouchDesigner/mcp_td_v147`; this dependency was not installed because F-02 does not own vendored TD test infrastructure. |
| Residual Risk | Team second-person sign-off, Level A/B evidence, equivalent condition fixtures, numeric margins, U1/U5 and Gate 2 remain open. |

### 2026-08-06 Complete R-01 Candidate Representation Package

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | R-01 contains a complete four-layer grammar, complete-condition comparison, measurable confound budget, neutral instructions, executable Schema assets and dependency-safe task transition. |
| Actual Result | Imported and sanitized the full Deep Research package; added local authorities and provenance; corrected storm to `3-3-3-3`; extracted the Schema, two valid fixtures, four directed negatives and a comprehension-truth fixture; added acceptance and validation authorities; marked R-01 `DONE` and W-01 `READY`. |
| Verified Evidence | DOI identities checked through Crossref records; seven source JSON blocks parsed; Draft 2020-12 metaschema passed; both condition fixtures passed; four negative fixtures were rejected; R-01, F-02, task-registry and protocol validators passed; task state is `DONE=F-02,R-01` and `READY=F-01,F-03,F-04,G-01,W-01`; 36 local Markdown links resolved; restricted terminology and internal citations were absent; scoped Python regression `42 passed in 19.11s`. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The source called the storm target structure unspecified although current project authorities freeze `3-3-3-3`. The F-02 validator also assumed R-01 could never advance beyond READY; it was corrected to accept unblocked downstream states. |
| Residual Risk | Fading-stage numeric timing, degraded cumulative behavior, recovery debounce, real-render confounds, Unity execution, team sign-off, reconstruction, Level evidence and Gate results remain open. |

### 2026-08-06 Remove Root CLAUDE.md

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The explicitly requested root file is absent, no active local link breaks, and unrelated worktree changes remain untouched. |
| Actual Result | Deleted root `CLAUDE.md`; retained historical mentions and kept `AGENTS.md` as the current project instruction authority. |
| Verification Command | Confirm `Test-Path CLAUDE.md` is false; search repository references; run `git diff --check`; audit staged scope; compare local and remote SHA after push. |
| Residual Risk | None within the requested deletion; historical documents still mention that the file existed at their recorded time. |

### 2026-08-06 Complete W-01 Closest-Work Candidate Package

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | W-01 provides reproducible candidate search strategies, a seven-axis closest-work matrix, claim-specific refutations, a one-paper contribution hierarchy, a traceable citation library and explicit limits on novelty claims. |
| Actual Result | Imported and sanitized the full external package; extracted structured CSV and BibTeX assets; added a DOI identity audit, acceptance record and dedicated validator; marked W-01 `DONE` while preserving `REVISE_REQUIRED`; kept W-02 at `WAIT_DEP` because A-04 is incomplete. |
| Verified Evidence | W-01 validator passed with 13 search rows, 15 core sources, six claims and 15 BibTeX entries; F-02 and R-01 validators passed; registry validator passed with 51 entries, `DONE=F-02,R-01,W-01` and `READY=F-01,F-03,F-04,G-01`; protocol firewall passed; Python compilation passed; 35 local Markdown links resolved; restricted terminology was absent from W-01 deliverables and status documents; scoped regression completed with `42 passed in 9.58s`; `git diff --check` passed. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The source contained 52 unusable internal citation markers, a future 2026-12-31 evidence cutoff, a mismatched time zone and two correctable bibliography issues. The first terminology scan also matched the project rule file and validator definitions themselves, so the delivery scan was narrowed to content-bearing documents while the W-01 validator retained direct enforcement. |
| Residual Risk | Native database exports, complete deduplication, two-person screening, high-threat full-text coding, independent reconstruction, Level evidence, Gate results and observed project effects remain open. |

### 2026-08-06 Freeze Four-Person Team Tool Baseline

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | Every team member has a precise common tool set, each role adds only the tools it owns, repository locks agree with the declared versions, and local gaps are reported rather than hidden. |
| Actual Result | Added the human-readable baseline, machine JSON, Python direct-dependency pins and a role-aware validator; linked the baseline from project entry points and synchronized the four-person priority note. |
| Verified Evidence | Authority validator passed for all role profiles, nine Python pins, Unity 6000.4.9f1 revision and selected Unity package locks. All five local profiles matched their required versions except the expected missing Zotero 9.0.6. Task registry and protocol validators passed; 20 local Markdown links resolved; restricted terminology was absent from baseline deliverables; scoped regression completed with `42 passed in 9.61s`; `git diff --check` passed. |
| Deviation / Surprise | VS Code is exposed through a Windows command shim, so the first validator implementation could not execute it directly from Python; the check now runs through `cmd.exe`. The project had no exact Python dependency snapshot, and the Unity MCP source still names `#main` despite a resolved commit in the package lock. |
| Residual Risk | Zotero is not installed on the coordinator machine; other member machines remain unaudited; Python transitive dependencies are not fully locked; Unity MCP source drift and optional TD MCP service setup remain open. |

### 2026-08-06 Correct Team Tool Baseline Scope

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | Unity, TouchDesigner and the frozen Python data-processing stack are common requirements for all four members, while role labels change ownership only and cannot remove environment checks. |
| Actual Result | Moved all three tool groups into the machine-readable common set, rewrote the human baseline around shared installation, removed all role-specific required-tool additions and made every local role mode run the same Unity, TouchDesigner and Python package checks. |
| Verified Evidence | Authority mode passed. All five local role labels checked Unity `6000.4.9f1`, TouchDesigner `2025.32820` and all nine Python pins, and each returned only the known Zotero `9.0.6` gap. Task registry and protocol authority validators passed; three local Markdown links resolved; restricted terminology was absent from added lines; scoped regression completed with `42 passed in 2.40s`; `git diff --check` passed. |
| Verification Command | Compile and run `validate_team_tool_baseline.py` in authority mode and for all five role labels; confirm every role reports only the known Zotero 9.0.6 gap on the coordinator machine; run task/protocol validators, Markdown-link and restricted-term checks, scoped Python regression and `git diff --check`. |
| Residual Risk | The other three machines remain unaudited; installed tools do not replace task-specific capability evidence; Python transitive dependencies and Unity MCP source drift remain open. |

### 2026-08-06 Narrow Zotero Installation Scope

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | Zotero 9.0.6 is required locally only for design and paper evidence governance; Unity and Python/data roles pass without it, while shared-library access remains mandatory for everyone. |
| Actual Result | Removed Zotero from the common executable set, assigned it to design and experiment/TD/governance role additions, added a machine-readable manual access requirement and made local validation conditional on those two roles. |
| Verified Evidence | Authority validation passed. `common`, `unity` and `python_data` passed with the complete shared technical stack and no local Zotero requirement; `design` and `experiment_td_governance` each reported Zotero as their only local gap. Task registry and protocol authority validators passed; three local Markdown links resolved; restricted terminology was absent from added lines; scoped regression completed with `42 passed in 2.44s`. |
| Verification Command | Run authority validation; confirm `common`, `unity` and `python_data` pass on the coordinator machine, while `design` and `experiment_td_governance` report only the known Zotero gap; run project validators, regression, link and terminology checks, and `git diff --check`. |
| Residual Risk | Shared-library permissions cannot be validated without member accounts and must be evidenced separately; the other three machines remain unaudited. |

### 2026-08-07 F-01 Runtime Contract Technical Closure

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | v2.1 legal fixtures pass; missing fields, wrong versions, formal Mock and duplicate controls fail closed; unknown compatible fields are ignored; existing Python behavior remains green; task package hashes remain deterministic. |
| Actual Result | Added strict runtime validation, combined JSON Schema, 11 fixtures and hashes, migration and port evidence. Registered TCP 5010 after a `NO_LISTENER` precheck. Kept v1.2 as a development-only compatibility path. |
| Verified Evidence | Contract suite `16 passed`; scoped project regression `58 passed`; READY package validator passed with 4 packages and 68 snapshots; registry validator passed with 51 entries; protocol authority v1.1 validator passed; F-02/R-01/W-01 validators remained green; `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed. |
| Deviation / Surprise | Initial contract test collection lacked the established `02-技术研发` import path and was fixed. The first protocol validator command used an obsolete filename; discovery found `validate_protocol_authority_v1_1.py`. The READY validator correctly rejected new outputs until they were explicitly staged as tracked files. |
| Residual Risk | Mandatory second-person interface review is open, so F-01 is not `DONE` and downstream tasks remain blocked. TCP 5010 is reserved but no service or LIVE_E2E exists. |

### 2026-08-06 Generate Individually Dispatchable READY Task Packages

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | Every current READY task has a separate package with a task brief, file authority, necessary inputs, acceptance and evidence fields; future READY changes cannot pass validation without regenerating the package set. |
| Actual Result | Added a four-task file mapping, deterministic renderer, dedicated validator, main-validator enforcement and project habit. Generated F-01, F-03, F-04 and G-01 directories with 48 input snapshots and 61 total package files. Text snapshots and hashes normalize line endings to LF and remove trailing whitespace, while binary snapshots retain raw-byte hashing. Added a narrow Git-ignore exception for package CSV snapshots and validator enforcement against ignored package files. |
| Verified Evidence | Dedicated validation passed with `READY packages=4; snapshots=48`; all 48 snapshot sources are Git-tracked; main registry validation passed with 51 entries and the expected READY set; two consecutive renders produced identical hashes for all 61 files; 116 local links in dispatch control documents resolved; restricted terminology was absent from the generated package tree; protocol authority validation passed; scoped regression completed with `42 passed in 3.79s`. |
| Verification Command | Run `13_render_ready_task_packages.py`, `14_validate_ready_task_packages.py` and `07_validate_task_packages.py`; compare recursive file hashes across two renders; validate links in package README/TASK/FILES documents; run restricted-term scan, scoped project regression and `git diff --check`. |
| Residual Risk | Snapshot-internal relative links may expect their original directories, so implementation must use the authority links in `FILES.md`; task work itself remains unstarted until a claimant records ownership. |

### 2026-08-07 F-01 Independent Review Remediation

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | Schema and the standard-library reference runtime have the same stateless accept/reject boundary; stateful control rejection is auditable; fixture evidence survives Git EOL handling; independent review has no unresolved P0-P2 finding. |
| Actual Result | Fixed all findings across four isolated review rounds, added actual Draft 2020-12 and cross-boundary tests, normalized fixture hashes, added a PowerShell consumer and regenerated deterministic READY packages. Final model review returned `PASS_FOR_MODEL_INDEPENDENT_REVIEW`. |
| Verified Evidence | Contract suite `42 passed`; scoped project regression `84 passed`; PowerShell non-Python consumer passed; fixture Git blob hashes `11/11`; READY package validator passed with 4 packages and 71 snapshots; registry, protocol authority, F-02, R-01 and W-01 validators passed; deterministic rerender passed. |
| Deviation / Surprise | Independent review found three successive layers of counterexamples before passing: initial semantic drift and missing audit evidence, then source/probability/fallback rules, then arbitrary-precision integer overflow. The final package-only drift was removed by regenerating after the last source edit. |
| Residual Risk | F-01 is still `READY` until a real non-implementing team member reviews and signs the exact pushed commit. No downstream runtime or full-system evidence is implied. |

### 2026-08-08 Project-Wide Defect Remediation

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | Native ECG timing is preserved; missing data does not produce scores; current ScoreFrame fields round-trip through CSV; invalid contract state fails closed; root tests are green; legacy materials cannot be mistaken for active inputs. |
| Actual Result | Implemented native ECG batches, explicit missingness, non-emitting warmup/invalid windows, CSV fail-closed schema, trend/clock/error/shutdown fixes, contract invariants, TD development-control gate, Unity formal-build blocker, lifecycle/status cleanup and evidence-entry quarantine. |
| Verified Evidence | Exact staged-snapshot pytest `100 passed`; fast simulation regression covered 600 frames and all four weather segments; paced 15-second mock run produced 51 valid CSV rows after warmup; registry PASS with READY=F-03/F-04/G-01 and IN_REVIEW=F-01; strict indexed dispatch-package validation passed with 4 packages/74 snapshots; protocol, F-02, R-01 and W-01 validators PASS; 20/20 legacy Markdown files marked. |
| Deviation / Surprise | The first clean staged snapshot exposed CRLF/LF hash drift for `.sha256`, `.ps1` and numbered `.gitattributes` snapshots that the primary worktree did not reveal. Renderer and validator now share the expanded text policy, with a two-script regression test; the subsequent clean staged snapshot passed. |
| Expected Red Gates | Unity batch validation exits with `FORMAL_SCENES_MISSING`; reference provenance validator exits `REFERENCE_PROVENANCE_BLOCKED`. These are enforced blockers, not completed capabilities. |
| Evidence Paths | `work/unity-formal-build-gate.log`; `02-技术研发/05-通信协议/F-01_技术验收记录.md`; generated dispatch manifests; this log. |
| Residual Risk | No formal Unity runtime, real device adapter, TD fixture replay, LIVE_E2E, external approval, participant evidence or publication-ready reference ledger exists. |

### 2026-08-08 Unity Source And Art Archive

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The archive contains the reopenable Unity source project and both in-project and external art sources, while excluding generated caches and editor recovery residue. |
| Actual Result | Created `04-成果与交付/Unity源文件与美术素材/SRP_Unity源文件与美术素材_20260808_142728.zip` with 536 entries and a size of 108.28 MiB. |
| Verified Evidence | ZIP reopened successfully; 40 C# files, 190 PNG files and 10 Unity scenes were enumerated; required `Packages/manifest.json`, `packages-lock.json` and `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` were present; duplicate names and excluded cache entries were both zero. |
| SHA-256 | `7792498EE0EF99E7DFA679C238628BF6F96151AB5BFB20926B5B256FBE2DF618` |
| Exclusions | `Library`, `Temp`, `Logs`, `obj`, `UserSettings` and `Assets/_Recovery`. |
| Residual Risk | This is a source snapshot of the current working tree, not a formal runtime build or LIVE_E2E acceptance artifact. |

### 2026-08-11 F-01 Human Second-Review Report Draft

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | A reviewer can bind the audit to one implementation SHA, inspect F-01-only differences, reproduce all current checks, record findings and sign without inheriting a model-generated conclusion. |
| Actual Result | Added a待签署 report with authority links, scope exclusions, exact commands, AC1-AC3 checks, findings fields, three mutually exclusive conclusions and a post-signature governance sequence. |
| Verified Evidence | Contract suite `49 passed`; root regression `100 passed`; PowerShell consumer returned `PASS_NON_PYTHON_CONSUMER`; task registry, dispatch-package and protocol authority validators passed. |
| Boundary | The report is not a signature. F-01 remains `IN_REVIEW`; no Unity, TouchDesigner, real-device or full-system completion is claimed. |
| Next Hard Gate | A real non-implementing team member fills and signs the report against `6c27c94a53c3eaa57d77b12a74626eb7442bfc0e`. |

### 2026-08-12 F-01 Signoff Closure And G-02 Dispatch Planning

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | The named second-person acceptance is bound to a commit; F-01 is the only task changing to `DONE`; only direct dependents with no other unmet prerequisites become `READY`; every READY task has an indexed independent package; G-02 has a decision-complete plan but no completion claim. |
| Actual Result | Recorded 傅钧烨 as team director and independent second reviewer using witnessed results and file review; created acceptance commit `58c9e41871214351a0fe96a413dfbc34d482ed4a`; migrated F-01, G-02, P-01 and P-02; regenerated the handbook, six packages and the fixed-task PDF; added the G-02 implementation plan. |
| Verified Evidence | Contract suite `49 passed in 1.50s`; root regression `100 passed in 13.82s`; PowerShell consumer PASS; registry PASS with 51 entries and READY=F-03/F-04/G-01/G-02/P-01/P-02; indexed package PASS with 6 packages and 77 snapshots; protocol authority PASS; all three PDF structure checks PASS. |
| PDF QA | `02_固定任务概要.pdf` contains 8 A4 pages, SHA-256 `E23243D839DF47BFBC94688B961DD12FA60C12ABE1EA97991E5AD0978B21561E`; eight rendered pages were visually inspected with no clipping, overlap or unreadable content. |
| Scope Guard | Existing four tracked deletions and the pre-existing untracked `SRP/`, root docx, `tmp/` and `work/unity-formal-build-gate.log` were excluded from staging. Historical records were not rewritten. |
| Residual Risk | F-01 does not establish downstream implementation or a full-system run. G-02 remains `READY`; dedicated-machine credentials, encrypted storage, retention approval, access controls, asset evidence and recovery rehearsal are not yet present. |

### 2026-08-13 P-01 SessionCore Candidate And Review Transition

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | Fixed v2.1 ordering, deterministic timing, formal fail-closed gates, reliable loopback controls and validated 20 Hz telemetry work without moving authority into Unity or TouchDesigner. |
| Actual Result | Added pure `SessionCore`, fixed sequence provider, formal adapter gates, TCP 5010 JSON Lines service, UDP 5005/5006 publisher, machine schemas, protocol configuration and a deterministic four-module golden trace. Implementation commit: `8063afc7053a79a0d27fe8fc94159dbc5fc9a9e0`. |
| Verified Evidence | P-01 suite `82 passed`; root regression `289 passed`; protocol authority passed; independent model rereview returned `PASS_FOR_MODEL_INDEPENDENT_REVIEW`; registry passed with READY=F-03/F-04/G-01/P-02 and IN_REVIEW=G-02/P-01; strict indexed package validation passed with 6 packages and 156 snapshots. |
| Independent Review | Three transport defects were fixed: fatal abort delivery/disconnect, semantic ACK propagation and local-clock telemetry throttling. Conservative exposure before start and permanent duplicate-request rejection were retained as intended. No P0-P2 remains in the model review. |
| PDF QA | `02_固定任务概要.pdf` contains 8 A4 pages, SHA-256 `2C1DCF288B9E2EFD86C92719CB95225D90575A87C79B29FFE8C432214D408BB4`; all pages were rendered at 120 DPI and visually checked with no clipping, overlap or unreadable content. |
| Scope Guard | The four pre-existing tracked deletions and pre-existing untracked `SRP/`, root docx, `tmp/` and `work/unity-formal-build-gate.log` remain excluded. |
| Residual Risk | Abort delivery is best effort if the connection is already lost. Human second review, P-02, X-01, Unity/TD consumers, real devices and `LIVE_E2E` remain open. |

### 2026-08-16 P-02 Durable Session Store Candidate And Review Transition

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | Manifest and L0/L1 are append-only; interrupted bytes remain unchanged; integrity drift is detected; complete P-01 operations replay deterministically without external side effects. |
| Actual Result | Added `srp_session_store`, three machine schemas, formal/development storage gates, P-01 and telemetry adapters, recovery, golden archive, stress generator and a pending human second-review report. Implementation commit: `3d740e99118d6a76993156f26bdf673144429025`. |
| Verified Evidence | P-02 suite `42 passed`; P-02/P-01/F-01/G-02 regression `288 passed`; root regression `331 passed`; protocol authority passed; independent model review returned `PASS_FOR_MODEL_INDEPENDENT_REVIEW`; registry passed with READY=F-03/F-04/G-01 and IN_REVIEW=G-02/P-01/P-02; dispatch package validation passed with 6 packages and 182 snapshots. |
| Stress Evidence | 800 seconds; PLUX 320000 samples; Polar 104000 samples; L1 16000 frames; integrity valid; eight post-warmup memory samples; no end-of-run growth over warmup. |
| Independent Review | Four rounds closed formal-capability bypass, privacy synonyms/path echo, seal cross-binding, abort preservation, prepare ordering, dual-device stress, and replay side-effect findings. No P0-P2 remains in the final model review. |
| PDF QA | `02_固定任务概要.pdf` contains 8 A4 pages and passed the brief verifier; all pages were rendered at 100 DPI and visually checked without clipping, overlap or unreadable text; SHA-256 `E220011680C7D5AA25F2EB87ED7F21C01D79C9C2EF94F59C2622157A05E0E5DF`. |
| Scope Guard | The four pre-existing tracked deletions and untracked `SRP/`, root docx, `tmp/` and `work/unity-formal-build-gate.log` remain excluded. |
| Residual Risk | Human second review, formal-machine checks, device adapters, Unity/TD consumers, X-01, A-01 and `LIVE_E2E` remain open. Hash chains detect integrity drift but are not digital signatures against a privileged malicious writer. |

### 2026-08-16 IN_REVIEW Independent Agent Audit

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | Three isolated read-only reviews bind findings to the fixed G-02, P-01 and P-02 implementation commits without changing task state or signing human reports. |
| Actual Result | All three reviews returned `REVIEW_FINDINGS_OPEN`; total findings are 0 P0, 4 P1, 4 P2 and 2 P3. |
| Verified Evidence | G-02 `107 passed`; P-01 `82 passed`; P-02 `42 passed`; cross-module `288 passed`; root `331 passed`; protocol, registry, package and diff checks passed. Fresh counterexamples still reproduced integrity and delivery gaps. |
| Report | `03-测试与实验/IN_REVIEW_Agent独立审核报告_2026-08-16.md` |
| State Guard | G-02, P-01 and P-02 remain `IN_REVIEW`. No pending human second-review report was edited or signed. |
| Residual Risk | Open P1 findings invalidate current model-review closure; code repair, regression tests and a fresh independent Agent pass are required before human signoff. |

### 2026-08-16 P1-P2-P3快速修复与复审

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Fixed Commit | `03d7426219121e49554e405db9dd521b8ab1d819` |

| Asset Gate | 179项清单；194个ignored发布文件与3个许可替换项；`release_allowed=false` |
| State Guard | G-02、P-01、P-02保持`IN_REVIEW`；待签署报告未代填结论 |
| Final Regression | 全仓`404 passed`；注册表、协议权威、6个独立包与182个快照校验通过 |

### 2026-08-17 Unity实验环境渐进搭建与任务协调

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | Unity任务从可复现环境开始，经可靠通信和四层接口汇合到一个完整风暴纵向切片，再扩展其他场景；未完成资产和上游签收门继续失败关闭。 |
| Actual Result | 新增E0至E5权威计划；F-03扩展为环境基线与会话运行壳；U-01补充P-01依赖；U-03先行；U-04至U-07改为在U-03后并行；I-01补充P-02依赖。READY和IN_REVIEW集合未改变。 |

| Scope Guard | 保留4个既有删除项和既有未跟踪`SRP/`、根docx、`tmp/`、`work/unity-formal-build-gate.log`，不纳入提交。 |
| Residual Risk | 本轮未运行Unity Editor、Unity测试或构建。P-01/P-02/G-02真实团队第二人签收、资产替换、正式环境、设备和`LIVE_E2E`仍开放。 |

### 2026-08-18 Unity场景设计流程订正与任务包落盘

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | Unity任务从研究体验契约和完整旅程开始，经概念原型、四层映射、分镜声音预演和全旅程灰盒后，再选择最高风险天气做纵向切片；技术基线不替代场景设计。 |
| Actual Result | 新增V-01至V-05，收缩F-03并重定U-01至U-07职责；注册表扩展为53个固定任务和3个模板；当前READY为F-03、F-04、G-01、V-01。 |
| Registry And Packages | `07_validate_task_packages.py`通过：56项、53固定任务、3模板；`14_validate_ready_task_packages.py`通过：7包、186快照；两次重生成文件哈希一致。 |

| Deviation | 图表首次误用默认Python并因缺少`matplotlib`失败；改用既有`D:\MathModelingTools\envs\cumcm\python.exe`后成功，未安装依赖。 |
| Scope Guard | 4个既有删除项和既有未跟踪`SRP/`、根docx、`tmp/`、`work/unity-formal-build-gate.log`继续排除。 |
| Residual Risk | 本轮未执行Unity Editor、Unity测试或构建；V-01至V-05、F-03及后续U任务仍需领取、实现、验收、第二人复核和各自提交推送。 |

### 2026-08-18 V-01 研究体验契约与完整旅程

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | 第一设计步只冻结研究体验、完整旅程、系统权威和证据边界；具体天气表现保持开放，V-02在第二人签收前不解锁。 |
| Implementation | 初始提交`285422314a2f091dad781b26981c2acb2e42fe10`；独立复核修复提交`293720f40126e2892b585c78fe7908518f40d4ad`。 |
| Contract Validation | `validate_v01_experience_contract.py`通过：与`protocol_authority_v1.1.json`一致，26个冻结/版本化约束、15个开放项、12个旅程节点和10条结构化主张。 |
| Negative Gates | TouchDesigner越权、条件单位漂移、场景原生包缺模块、C-001状态越界四类变异均被拒绝。 |
| Agent Review | Agent `01a012e3-ebfb-7fc0-8747-7d492e8aa612`首轮返回3个P2和1个P3；修复后二轮返回`PASS_NO_OPEN_P1_P3`。 |
| Regression | `py -3.14 -m pytest -q`通过：`404 passed in 17.63s`；协议权威验证通过。 |
| Registry And Packages | 56项注册表通过：53固定任务、3模板、READY=F-03/F-04/G-01、IN_REVIEW=G-02/P-01/P-02/V-01；7个分发包、196个快照通过。 |

| PDF QA | `02_固定任务概要.pdf`为9页，SHA-256 `2E314D87D72AF274228DF0F67C47D81DA7B39E4D9C0EFEE87270377DEA426585`；9页联系表及第4、8页重点复查无裁切、重叠或状态冲突。 |
| State Guard | V-01只转为`IN_REVIEW`；真实团队第二人栏保持`PENDING`，V-02继续`WAIT_DEP`。 |
| Scope Guard | 4个既有删除项和既有未跟踪`SRP/`、根docx、`tmp/`、`work/unity-formal-build-gate.log`继续排除。 |
| Residual Risk | 静态设计契约不能替代Unity独立构建、跨端权限测试、真实设备链和`LIVE_E2E`证据；这些由后续任务关闭。 |

### 2026-08-18 V-01签收闭环与V-02解锁

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Expected Observation | 真实团队第二人签收证据与治理迁移分成两个提交；V-01转为`DONE`后才允许V-02转为`READY`，且不扩大为Unity运行完成。 |

### 2026-08-21 G-01领取返工与IN_REVIEW迁移

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Acceptance Baseline | `03-测试与实验/G-01_验收记录_2026-08-21.md`：对`origin/main`根目录8个文件的验收结论为不通过（流程违规、G-01-01缺失、时长口径矛盾、40预约vs100会话矛盾、责任人占位、术语命中5处、格式残留）。 |
| Branch And Claim | 新分支`codex/g-01-research-governance`基于`codex/v-02-concept-design`（含最新治理状态；`origin/main`注册表落后于该分支，故不从main建支）；8个文件从`origin/main`取回并`git mv`至规划包`06_步骤05_伦理与预试材料/`，补齐`.md`扩展名。注册表G-01：`READY`→`IN_PROGRESS`（claimant=Codex、branch、reviewer=傅钧烨）→返工后`IN_REVIEW`。 |
| Rework Content | 新增`G-01-01_单次参与材料.md`（v1.1流程权威+材料清单D-01~D-11）；G-01-02/03时长对齐v1.1基准（PANAS 2~3、猜测2~3、问卷≤5、补充知情同意与清理环节）、Polar H10表述修正为胸带式；G-01-04责任人落实R-007、M-001中文版来源给候选并标注待核验、新增许可证据索引E-001~E-008；G-01-06修正"完全相同模块"表述、修复Mermaid围栏、移除AI残留说明段；G-01-07/08演练窗口统一为D1~D14（执行期7天）、计划产能140次、U8通过线112次、预约目标165人（112÷0.85÷0.80≈164.7），补偿成本改可重建公式；G-01-09移除孤立围栏；新增`G-01-10_双人审查记录.md`（第一审查PASS候选级，第二人复核开放）。 |
| Terminology Gate | 禁用词扫描（诊断/治疗/疾病/患者/医疗设备/临床）对`06_步骤05_伦理与预试材料/G-01-*.md`全目录0命中；原"心脑血管疾病/心理治疗/医疗诊断证明"已改写，安全筛查语义保留。 |
| Registry Validation | `07_validate_task_packages.py`通过：57项、54固定、3模板，`DONE=F-01/F-02/R-01/V-01/V-02/W-01`、`READY=F-03/F-04/V-03`、`IN_REVIEW=G-01/G-02/P-01/P-02`。 |
| Package Validation | `13_render_ready_task_packages.py`重生成；`14_validate_ready_task_packages.py`通过：7包、190个输入快照。 |
| Regression | `py -3.14 -m pytest -q`通过：`404 passed in 17.71s`。 |
| Diff Gate | 行尾空白已清理；`git diff --check --cached`通过，仅有既有LF→CRLF转换提示。 |
| Scope Guard | 4个既有删除项、`SRP/`、根docx、`tmp/`、`work/unity-formal-build-gate.log`继续排除在提交外。 |
| Final Boundary | G-01转`IN_REVIEW`不等于DONE：AC3真实演练未执行、U8未判定、M-001许可`PENDING`、伦理路径与真实团队第二人复核保持开放；正式阶段继续阻断。 |

### 2026-08-21 G-01独立Agent复审两轮闭环

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Independent Review R1 | Agent `agent-0`（explore只读）首轮结论`REVIEW_FINDINGS_OPEN`：P1×1（G-01-06流程基准缺阶段0/7）、P2×4（G-01-09门控表语义越界读法、12_20/11_17悬空引用、G-01-08旧文件名、G-01-10扫描声明自相矛盾）、P3×3（列表渲染/日期伪影、D-11来源、包生命周期表述）。产能数字（528/140/112/165）逐步核算通过，权威一致性通过。 |
| Fix Commit | `3299149` fix(g01)：B1~B8全部修复；禁用词复扫0命中、围栏配平、`git diff --check`通过；已推送。 |
| Independent Review R2 | 同一Agent闭环验证：B1~B8全部确认关闭，G-01-06§2与G-01-01§2逐项一致；增量发现G01-N1（P3，版本留痕缺失）及附观察（G-01-01上限合计62→58分钟）。 |
| N1 Closure | G-01-01/02/03/06/07/08/09补版本记录行（含发现编号），G-01-10新增第5节修订记录；G-01-01"约62分钟"核正为"约58分钟"。 |
| Audit Report | `03-测试与实验/G-01_Agent独立审核报告_2026-08-21.md`：总结论`MODEL_REVIEW_FINDINGS_CLOSED / HUMAN_SECOND_REVIEW_PENDING`。 |
| Kanban | 看板G-01行同步独立复审关闭信息；注册表状态不变（IN_REVIEW）。 |
| PR State | PR #1（c010482）已由用户合并进main（2f8e6ae），远端分支被自动删除；修复提交推送后重建同名远端分支，需新PR携带复审修复与留痕。 |
| Final Boundary | 模型复审关闭只解除模型复审阻断；第二人签署、M-001许可、伦理路径、U8演练保持开放，G-01不转DONE。 |

| State Migration | P-01、P-02转`DONE`；F-05随之解锁为`READY`（新增17个源文件映射，全部验证存在）；G-01（AC3演练/U8/M-001许可/伦理开放）、G-02（专机6项缺失/保留期限/197项资产门开放）签收PASS但保持`IN_REVIEW`。 |
| Package Regeneration | P-01/P-02包移出分发，F-05包新增，G-02映射内待签署引用修正为已签署；`07`通过：`DONE=F-01/F-02/P-01/P-02/R-01/V-01/V-02/W-01`、`READY=F-03/F-04/F-05/V-03`、`IN_REVIEW=G-01/G-02`；`14`通过：6包130快照。 |
| Entry Sync | 看板、AGENTS.md、README.md（已签署链接）同步。 |
| Final Boundary | P-01/P-02的DONE不扩大为Unity、TD、真实设备或`LIVE_E2E`完成；G-01/G-02的外部门继续阻断正式阶段。 |

### 2026-08-21 G-01/G-02外部门关闭预备制品

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| G-01-11 | `08_步骤07_伦理提交与LevelA/G-01-11_伦理提交执行检查清单.md`：v1.0清单（SUPERSEDED）执行版，A~F六组逐项映射G-01交付物/责任角色/状态（✅/⬜/🔒），E.1汇总6款待冻结字段；机构路径确认前不得对外提交。 |

| Package Check | ZIP可读取；包含F-04交付、fixture、工具和TouchDesigner施工图，但同时夹带未声明的`F-01/`目录，包级范围不洁。未发现截图、录屏、`.toe/.toa`、节点检查或TD运行日志。 |
| Static Fixture | `f04_validate_fixture.py`通过：11条记录、四模块、四类告警、乱序、降级及dropout/recovered覆盖。 |
| Python Syntax | `py_compile`通过：fixture validator、sender、TD施工图脚本。 |
| Readonly Boundary | manifest中的五项边界声明均为`false`；静态代码仅创建UDP输入、表、回调、容器和展示面板，未发现Unity/Spout输出、随机化、阈值编辑或设备驱动调用。 |
| Runtime Evidence | 未在TouchDesigner内执行施工图、未发送UDP并观察页面更新；因此AC1/AC3仅有脚本/fixture级证据，不能升级为TD页面验收。 |
| Human Gate | 未提供第二人操作复核/签收；F-04任务完成条件未满足。 |
| Decision | `NO-GO / RETURN_FOR_EVIDENCE`：静态候选可审阅，F-04不可签收为完成。 |

### 2026-08-27 F-04 前期设计与运行合同深度核对

| Field | Result |
|---|---|
| Authority Health | 协议权威校验`PASS`；任务注册表`PASS`（F-04=`READY`）；独立任务包`PASS`；F-01合同测试`49 passed`；非Python消费者`PASS`。当前对照基线有效。 |
| Acceptance Drift | 项目F-04 AC2是“关闭TD不影响其他制品”，AC3是“无Spout输出、随机化或阈值编辑入口”；附件改写为AC2只读边界、AC3异常状态展示，遗漏原AC2并自行改变验收编号和语义。 |
| Contract Compatibility | 正式TelemetryFrame有29个顶层字段；附件首帧28个字段中仅`session_id`与正式合同同名，缺28个正式字段并新增27个demo字段。F-01参考校验器以`MISSING_FIELD: schema_version,message_type`拒绝附件。 |
| Port and Module Drift | 项目权威和全局端口注册表固定TD遥测为UDP 5005；附件硬编码未登记的9054。正式天气标识为`storm/heat/snow/fade`；附件硬编码`storm/scorching/blizzard/fading`。 |
| Page Coverage | 10类权威页面中，设备连接、目标/实际相位2类完整；会话/版本、ECG/RR质量、周期结果、延迟/时钟偏差、降级5类部分实现；原始/滤波呼吸、日志写入、中止/人工标记3类缺失。AC1“全部页面”不成立。 |
| Static Quality | fixture自检与Python编译通过；无监听时sender可发送11条UDP记录并正常退出。施工图静态保持只读，但未校验正式schema/version，解析任意JSON后以默认值继续显示。 |
| Evidence Quality | 无F-04专用`.toe/.toa`、截图、节点权限导出、TD控制台日志、fixture回放录像、固定提交/哈希清单或第二人复核；项目权威工作目录中也没有附件F-04文件。 |
| Package Hygiene | ZIP夹带未声明`F-01/`目录，且F-04交付没有包级manifest绑定文件与哈希。附件称“等待F-01正式合同”，但F-01已于2026-08-12签收为DONE，说明前期状态读取过期。 |
| Quality Decision | `REWORK_REQUIRED`。STATIC仅为部分可读原型；CONTRACT=`FAIL`；INTEGRATION/TD_RUNTIME=`NOT_OBSERVED`；HUMAN_ACCEPTANCE=`NOT_OBSERVED`。F-04保持`READY`，不得进入第二人签收。 |
| Required Repair Order | 先恢复原AC语义并改用v2.1字段、5005和正式天气标识；补齐10类页面骨架；强化schema/version失败关闭；生成TD运行制品与证据；清理并重打交付包；最后第二人操作复核。 |
